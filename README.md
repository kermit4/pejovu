CJP2P - Connectionless JSON P2P Protocol

A connectionless, simple, interoperable, expansible, p2p protocol, inspired by https://farcaster.xyz/vitalik.eth/0xd6b8e141 and https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243

# as seen in the wild 


## protocol 
JSON array of messages.   Please make a PR into here if you spot any new fields or messages.

## message types 
### MUST implement
#### Like an HTTP Cookie, send it back with any message to the node that provided it.   (This is so you don't spoof your IP to use a node as a flood by making a small sized request for a large sized of reply.  Without it, you'll probably be ignored, rate limited, get very short replies.)
```JSON
{"PleaseAlwaysReturnThisMessage":["any",{"valid":"JSON"}]}
{"AlwaysReturned":               ["any",{"valid":"JSON"}]}  
```
### SHOULD implement
#### Peer discovery
```JSON
{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}
{"Peers":{
      "peers":[
          "148.71.89.128:43344",
          "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }

{"PleaseReturnThisMessage":["any",{"valid":"JSON"}]}
{"ReturnedMessage":        ["any",{"valid":"JSON"}]}  
```

### MAY implement
#### a basic use. EOF refers to the full completed length of the content.  
```JSON
{"PleaseSendContent":{
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "length":4096,
      "offset":0 }}
{ "Content": { 
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "base64": "aGk=",
      "eof": 2,           
      "offset":0 } }
{"MaybeTheyHaveSome":{
       "id":"foo",
      "peers":[ "148.71.89.128:43344", "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }

```

## implementations
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-rust (implements everything listed above and far the most developed and intelligent)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-ruby (most protocol features, but not intelligent)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-bash (most protocol features, but not intelligent, slow transfers)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-haskell (very few features)

## likely to be running nodes
148.71.89.128:24254
159.69.54.127:24254

# development hints:
  echo -n '[{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}]' |nc -u localhost -p 12321 24254

  tcpdump -As 9999 -i any port 24254

The file sharing is more of a primitive than a main purpose, providing applications a way to reliably receive data of arbitrary size from many peers.

The protocol should sound more like people than computers.   Simple requests, share a lot, expect little, be tolerant -- you're talking to strangers using automation, not computers.  Prefer to leave decisions up to implementations.  It's a language for ordinary people using automation.  Everyone starts somewhere, keep it accessable to any programming skill level, with more advanced features optional (or not, it's up to you on your node and implementation).

pay attention to unhandled messages and try to handle them, or make your own -- you don't have to wait for some official protocol update to add messages or fields, just don't crash if you receive some.

# future possibilities

## protocol ideas:
- large files as a series of sha256sums of 256K blocks. so parts can be shared before its all done, and errors dont cause a complete retransfer.
- streams, i.e. a running series of sha256sums which are fetched with PleaseSendContent
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders, with consensus (like a blockchain)
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders, without consensus 
- encryption something like MyTemporaryPublicKey{e25519:"in base64"}      EncryptedMessages{base64:"some base64 that decrypts to an array of JSON messages"}
- economics to incentivize resource sharing
- 1:1 chat.  even slow asym encryption would be nice here.
- group chats (this is actually a many to many channel without consensus)
- chat message white or black listing to avoid spam, and sharing the lists
- synchronized media playback between peers (i dont know why, it just seems fun...a shared experience, at a distance, would go well with group chats)
-- RecommendedContent message type?   Some people like to share!  And not just spammers.  (How to reduce that noise?i multiple sources of recommendation? end user must approve..and not Sybil. an IPv4 is valid scarcity.)
