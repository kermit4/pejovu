Lowest Common Denominator Protocol tracking page

LCDP is a simple, interoperable, expansible, message oriented peer to peer protocol, allowing participants to keep only as much state about peers as     they prefer, implementing only the message types of interest, with minimal latency, and perpetual compatibility by extension not versioning,

# protocol 
UTF-8 encoded JSON array of externally tagged messages.   Post new message types or field on https://github.com/kermit4/LCDP/wiki   Do not change the meaning of already used messages except by adding fields.   Tolerate unrecognized messages and fields.

## message types 
### SHOULD implement
#### Send it back with any message to the node that provided it (but not just by itself, that's not the purpose).   Currently, this is only used so no one can fake ("spoof") their source IP to use a node to spam ("flood") someone else.   Messages recieved without the correct AlwaysReturned should only be sent responses that, on average, are no more than twice the size of such messages received.  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing )        .  Or any other means you can know your response isn't multiplying traffic more than 2.5x to an unwilling recipient.
```JSON
{"PleaseAlwaysReturnThisMessage":["cookie","String"]
{"AlwaysReturned":               ["cookie","String"]
```
### MAY implement
#### Peer discovery
```JSON
{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}
{"Peers":{
      "peers":[
          "148.71.89.128:43344",
          "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }
{"WhereAreThey":{"ed25519h": "hex of ed25519 sought, if found returns a MyPublicKey wrapped in a Forwarded, so you know where it came from"}}
{"PleaseListSupportedMessages":{}}
{"SupportedMessages":{}}
```
#### ping -- participants might use this to prioritize which peers to keep track of and which to keep in touch with more. Send it back and forget it, as it is probably a timestamp.
```
{"PleaseReturnThisMessage":["cookie","String"]
{"ReturnedMessage":        ["cookie","String"]
```

#### for larger than message sized data
```JSON
{"PleaseSendContent":{
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "length":4096,
      "offset":0 }}
{ "Content": { 
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "base64": "aGk=",
      "eof": 2,           
      "offset":0 } }
{"MaybeTheyHaveSome":{
       "id":"foo",
      "peers":[ "148.71.89.128:43344", "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }
```

#### cryptography related
```JSON
{ "EncryptedMessages": {
      "base64": "base64 of encrypted array of externally tagged JSON messagess, i.e. this protocol, encrypted",
      "noise_params": "Noise_IK_25519_AESGCM_SHA256"
    } }
{ "MyPublicKey": {
      "ed25519h": "hex (no 0x in front)",
      "ed25519_eth_signed": "optionally, a eth wallet signed message of: my ed25519 public key is 12345678abcdef"
        } }
{"GetPubByEth":{ "eth_addr": "hex of eth address you want to find the ed25519 for, if found it will return a MyPublicKey wrapped in a Forwarded so you know where it really came from"}}
{"Forwarded":{"src":"1,2.3.4:45678","from_ed25519":"only if verified","maybe_ed25519":"if not verified for this message, but from a source that claims to be this key" ,"messages":"a string that is this protocol"}}
{"SignedMessage":{"ed25519":"hex of sender's public key","signature":"base64 ed25519 signature of payload","payload":"base64 of a JSON messages array (this protocol)"}}
```
`SignedMessage` wraps any array of messages with an ed25519 signature so receivers can verify authorship.  `Latest` (see below) must be delivered inside a `SignedMessage`.
#### updateable named content
Ask for the latest known signed hash of a named file published by an ed25519 key.  The response is a `SignedMessage` wrapping a `Latest`.
```JSON
{"GetLatest":{"ed25519":"hex of publisher's public key","name":"filename (no path separators)"}}
{"Latest":{"ed25519":"hex of publisher's public key","name":"filename","sha256":"hex sha256 of current content","seq":1234567890}}
```
`seq` is typically the file's modification time as Unix seconds.  `Latest` is only valid inside a `SignedMessage` whose `ed25519` matches; nodes drop it otherwise.
#### websocket client helper
Ask the node to forward messages to a peer identified by ed25519 public key, encrypting with `EncryptedMessages`.  The only known implementation will currently ignore these arriving from the network.
```JSON
{"Forward":{"to_ed25519":"hex of destination public key","messages":[...]}}
```

## implementations
### of the node
- In Rust https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-rust/ (for verified builds)(implements everything listed above, and more, and by far the most developed and intelligent, so also not the simplest example to read)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-ruby (most protocol features, not very intelligent, but much much easier to read than the more developed Rust version, even if you know Rust and not Ruby)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-bash (most protocol features, but not intelligent, slow transfers, easy to read if you know BASH but not Rust)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-haskell (very few features)
- There's rumors of a Go version but I haven't seen the code
### Web based interfaces to the node
 https://oneplusone.bzz.link/ - has a blank to input a different websocket URL if you dont have one running at localhost
 https://azai.net/pong.html pong with a very useful latency chart
 https://azai.net/video.html  video calls


## likely to be running nodes
- UDP 148.71.89.128:24254
- UDP 159.69.54.127:24254

# development hints:
  echo -n '[{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}]' |nc -u localhost -p 12321 24254

  tcpdump -As 9999 -i any port 24254

  You could make something useful by implimenting no more than WhereAreThey and ChatMessage, or just as examples, or only PleaseSenContent, or just WhereAreThey and AudioFrame, or only PleaseReturnThisMessage, or some new type of your own. 

The protocol should sound more like people than computers.   Simple requests, share a lot, expect little, be tolerant -- you're talking to strangers using automation, not computers.  Prefer to leave decisions up to implementations.  It's a language for ordinary people using automation.  Everyone starts somewhere, keep it accessible to any programming skill level, with more advanced features optional (or not, it's up to you on your node and implementation).  Use long names for things, bandwidth is cheaper than explanations.

Pay attention to unhandled messages and consider implementing them. Make your own -- you don't have to wait for some official protocol update to add messages or fields, just don't crash if you receive some, post about it here or somewhere and check that no one else has used it.  The namespace is virtually unlimited.

## test files available (under both their SHA256 hash and name, though the Rust implementation expects it to be a SHA256)

# future possibilities

## protocol ideas:
- content.is_metadata, to include a list of hashes for huge files or streams that we want to verify as we go. (which could themselves do the same for really huge files)
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders, with consensus (like a blockchain or DAG)
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders, without consensus 
- economics to incentivize resource sharing
- group chats (this is actually a many to many channel without consensus)
- chat message white or black listing to avoid spam, and sharing the lists
- synchronized media playback between peers (i dont know why, it just seems fun...a shared experience, at a distance, would go well with group chats, like the 1990s when video was usually in sync)
- many more ideas in https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-rust 
- make a IETF draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/tool-instructions/
