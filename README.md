CJP2P - Connectionless JSON P2P Protocol

A connectionless, simple, interoperable, expansible, p2p protocol, inspired by https://farcaster.xyz/vitalik.eth/0xd6b8e141 and https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243

# as seen in the wild 

Implement or extend as much or as little as you like, or something new!   

## protocol 
JSON array of message

## message types 
```JSON
### layer 1
{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}
{"Peers":{
      "peers":[
          "148.71.89.128:43344",
          "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }
{"PleaseSendContent":{
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "length":4096,
      "offset":0 }}
{ "Content": { 
      "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
      "base64": "aGk=",
      "eof": 2,           // this refers to the full length of the content, not specific to this message
      "offset":0 } }
{"PleaseReturnThisMessage":{...}}   
{"ReturnedMessage":{...}}  // probably for timestamping, maybe other things, like an HTTP cookie.   Send it all back with your reply, if there is any reply to send.
{"MaybeTheyHaveSome":{"id":"foo",
      "peers":[ "148.71.89.128:43344", "148.71.89.128:50352"] } } // suggest where else to look for foo, this is likely in reply to PleaseSendContent
}}   
```
### layer 2 (built upon the layer 1 functionality)
TBD 

## implementations
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-rust (implements everything listed above and by most the most developed and intelligent)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-ruby (most protocol features, but not intelligent)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-bash (most protocol features, but not intelligent, slow transfers)
- https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p-haskell (very few features)

## likely to be running nodes
148.71.89.128:24254
159.69.54.127:24254

# development hints:
  echo -n '[{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}]' |nc -u localhost 24254

  tcpdump -As 9999 -i any port 24254

The file sharing is more of a primitive than a main purpose, providing applications a way to reliably receive data of arbitrary size from many peers.

The protocol should sound more like people than computers.   Simple requests, share a lot, expect little, be tolerant -- you're talking to strangers using automation, not computers.  Prefer to leave decisions up to implementations.  It's a language for ordinary people using automation.  Everyone starts somewhere, keep it accessable to any programming skill level, with more advanced features optional (or not, it's up to you on your node and implementation).

pay attention to unhandled messages and try to handle them, or make your own -- you don't have to wait for some official protocol update or new messages or new fields.

# future possibilities

## protocol ideas:
- checksums of the message array
- my current train of thought is that a large file is a series of small files of known hashes, which would support streaming, so the core function of obtaining content based on a hash does not need sub-hashes for verifiable streaming or relaying large files before they're done, instead whats needed is to get a file of hashes or some other "protocol" on top of the basic "get content of this hash" protocol.
- "hi" messages just to keep peers active in peer lists?   3 way with timestamps?
- timestamp requests to learn most responsive service from your location (and some protocol that replies return these timestamps)
- some way to prevent being used as a DDOS by replying to a spoofed IP (some sort of cookie/handshake..calculated by a local random, to not need to remember them all)
- need checksums of blocks before complete, confirmed data before sending it on, otherwise a bad bit may copy around forever, breaking a file
- public keys in "Receive peers."
- streams, i.e. files that keep growing..maybe just make eof an optional field
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders
- encryption
- economics to incentivize resource sharing
- chat
- chat message white listing to avoid spam
