CJP2P - Connectionless JSON P2P Protocol

A connectionless, simple, interoperable, expansible, p2p protocol, inspired by https://farcaster.xyz/vitalik.eth/0xd6b8e141 and https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243

# as seen in the wild 

Implement or extend as much or as little as you like, or something new!   

## protocol 
JSON array of message

## message types 
```JSON
- {"PleaseSendPeers":{}}
- {"Peers":{
        "peers":[
            "148.71.89.128:43344",
            "148.71.89.128:50352"] } }
- {"PleaseSendContent":{
        "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
        "length":4096,
        "offset":0 }}
- { "Content": { 
        "id":"8f434346648f6b96df89dda901c5176b10a6d83961dd3c1ac88b59b2dc327aa4",
        "base64": "aGk=",
        "eof": 2,
        "offset":0 } }
- {"PleaseReturnThisMessage":{...}}   
- {"ReturnedMessage":{...}}  // probably for timestamping, maybe other things, like an HTTP cookie.   Send it all back with your reply, if there is any reply to send.
```

## implementations

## likely to be running nodes
148.71.89.128:24254
159.69.54.127:24254

# development hints:
  echo -n '[{"PleaseSendPeers":{}}]' |nc -u localhost 24254

  tcpdump -As 9999 -i any port 24254

This file sharing is more of a primitave than a main purpose, providing applications a way to reliably receive data of arbitrary size from many peers.

The protocol should sound more like people than computers.   Simple requests, share a lot, expect little, be tolerant -- you're talking to strangers using automation.  Prefer to leave decisions up to implementations.  It's a language for common people.

pay attention to unhandled messages and try to handle them, or make your own -- you don't have to wait for some official protocol update or new messages or new fields.

# future possibilities

## protocol ideas:
- checksums of the message array
- "hi" messages just to keep peers active in peer lists?   3 way with timestamps?
- timestamp requests to learn most responsive service from your location (and some protocol that replies return these timestamps)
- some way to prevent being used as a DDOS by replying to a spoofed IP (some sort of cookie/handshake..calculated by a local random, to not need to remember them all)
- need checksums of blocks before complete, confirmed data before sending it on, otherwise a bad bit may copy around forever, breaking a file
- public keys in "Receive peers."
- include suggestions as to where else to request content in replies to PleaseSendContent.
- streams, i.e. files that keep growing
- channels, like a stream but multiple senders
- encryption
- economics to insentivize resource sharing
- chat
- chat message whitelisting to avoid spam
